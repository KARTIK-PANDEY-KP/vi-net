# üì¨ Flask Gmail API App with Firestore Token Storage and bot_backend for LinkedIn automation

This project allows users to log in with their Google account, give consent to access Gmail, and then send or read emails programmatically using just their username. All Gmail OAuth tokens are securely stored in Firestore using a service account.

### 4. Create a `.env` file

```env
# Redis Configuration (only needed if you add sessions later)
REDIS_PASSWORD=[password]

# Flask Session (optional)
FLASK_SESSION_KEY=[password]

# Google Cloud Credentials
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./firestore-creds.json

# File Paths
GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_PATH=./GCP_gmail_api_credentials.json
FIRESTORE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=./firestore-creds.json

# Linkd API Configuration
LINKD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  # Required for people search functionality

# Flask Configuration
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_DEBUG=1

# Server Configuration
PORT=8080
HOST=0.0.0.0
```

---

## üöÄ Run the App

## üí° Usage Flow

### 1. User Registration
Open in browser:

```
http://localhost:8080/
```

- Enter a **custom username** (e.g. `user123`)
